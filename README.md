# Blinkit-SQL-Based-Business-Analysis
Welcome to my SQL project based on Blinkit, a leading quick-commerce grocery delivery platform. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, inventory status, and payment insights using structured SQL queries.

🔍 Project Overview This project simulates a real-world Blinkit database with multiple interconnected tables such as:

.Customers

.Orders

.OrderDetails

.Products

.Payments

.Inventory

.Delivery

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from sales and operational data to drive decision-making.

📊 Key Insights & Use Cases .Top-selling products based on quantity and revenue

.Monthly & yearly revenue trends to track performance

.Customer segmentation based on spending and frequency

.Delivery analysis for on-time vs delayed orders

.Inventory monitoring for stockouts and fast-moving items
